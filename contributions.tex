This project aim is a supplement to the app store Ubibazaar. The goal is a functional prototype that supports uploading of sketches on a wireless network connection via Bluetooth from an Android version of the app store to an Arduino microcontroller. This will be a new method and an improved computer-based product for the app store Ubibazaar.

The new concept includes another type of Bluetooth moodule, Bluefruit EZ-Link Shield, which will be connected onto an Arduino Uno microcontroller. The Bluetooth connection to the Android app should be more smooth with this module since the Arduino re-programming and communation capability should be completely transparent.

Further development will include a cohesion between the Android app store and the web app store so Ubibazaar be whole. This functionality will be new to Ubibazaar, even if the concept with a Bluetooth connection for the data transfer has been used before in other projects.
