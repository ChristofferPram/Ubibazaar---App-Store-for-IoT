\section{Participants}

As the only project member, I am the project leader for this project. I will coordinate the project plan, design and document the product and finally develop and test it. The research is supervised by Babak Farshchian, and he will offer guidance when needed during this project.

The end-users of this app store is the maker community and so there will be necessary to have some contact with some makers or researchers to be able to get some useful feedback. All feedback will be evaluated objectively and discussed together with the results.
