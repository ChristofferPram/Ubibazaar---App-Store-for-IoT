\section{Research Method}

There will be a lot of literature review in the beginning of this project to get familiar with the details of the different programming fields. And also on how to find which technology, architecture and tools to use for the deployment. Experiences and motivation will affect how the product will be presented to the end-user and also to find out if the solution is ideal for IoT apps distribution.

There will be necessary to develop a conceptual framework with a comprehensive perspective so all the pieces of the app store will be fit together in the bigger picture.

The strategy to execute these methods will be through design and creation of the system. The collection of data generated from this type of project will come from the documentation and also from observations of the end-user. The data analysis will be qualitative with focus on the end-users thought on usability and availability and also of the success rate of fulfilled requirements at deadline.
