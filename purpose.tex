\section{Purpose}

The Internet of Things has become a more common phrase of today's world. A definition has been given by Ivy Wigmore:

The Internet of Things (IoT) is an environment in which objects, animals or people are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. (I. Wigmore, 2014).\cite{iotdefinition}

The development of the Internet of Things has expanded drastically the last few years. A lot of electronics and robotics have been created with the need of monitoring and controlling them, such as sensors, measure devices, smart devices and 3D printers. The huge increase of unique \textit{Things} is due to the makers innovation. This innovation is caused by the evolution of the maker culture and the increased availability of Do-It-Yourself (DIY) from guides and blogs on the Internet.

All these things are created by different people, with different experiences and different tools. A serious challenge of this free development is that the Internet of Things will become a huge complex structure of hardware that will have difficulties communicating with each other.\cite{standardChallenge} And that is why we need to develop shared standards and infrastructures Too make the innovation regarding Internet of Things more efficient, there is a need to gather 






"Describe the reason for doing the research, the topic of interest, why it is important or useful to study this, the specific research question(s) asked and the objectives set. Research without a purpose is unlikely to be good research." (Oates 2005)


Write in this section about the following:
What is the problem? Whose problem is it? Refer to 2-3 good scientific references that confirm for the reader that this is actually a relevant problem.


What is done earlier to address this problem? Give 4-5 good references that illustrate the different approaches taken by other researchers to solve this problem. (you might also consider to do an in-depth literature review as part of your autumn project).
What is wrong with earlier research? Did they not manage to solve the problem? Why? Why is your approach going to be better? What new knowledge do you plan to add?
Summarize with a list of clearly defined research questions. One main question and 2-3 sub-questions related to the main question. Note that the sub-questions should contribute to answer the main question.
